                        <p>Business is the activity of making one's living or making money by producing or buying and
                            selling
                            products (<strong>goods and services</strong>).Simply put, it is "any activity or enterprise
                            entered
                            into for profit. It does not mean it is a company, a corporation, partnership, or have any
                            such formal
                            organization, but it can range from a street peddler to General Motors."[5] The term is also
                            often used
                            colloquially (<strong>but not by lawyers or public officials</strong>) to refer to a
                            company, but this
                            article will not deal with that sense of the word.</p>
                        <p> Anyone carrying on an activity that earns them a profit is doing <u>business or running a
                                business</u>, and perhaps this is why there is a misconception that business and company
                            is the same
                            thing.<br>
                            A business name structure does not separate the business entity from the owner, which means
                            that the
                            owner of the business is responsible and liable for all debts incurred by the business. If
                            the business
                            acquires debts[,] the creditor or creditors can go after your personal possessions. A
                            business structure
                            does not allow for corporate tax rates. The proprietor is personally taxed on all income
                            from the
                            business.</p>
                        <p> A company on the other hand, is a separate legal entity and provides for limited liability
                            as well as
                            corporate tax rates. A company structure is more complicated and expensive to set up, but
                            offers more
                            protection and benefits for the owner.</p>

                        <p> Corporation: The owners of a corporation have limited liability and the business has a
                            separate legal
                            personality from its owners. Corporations can be either government-owned or privately owned.
                            They can
                            organize either for profit or as nonprofit organizations. A privately owned, for-profit
                            corporation is
                            owned by its shareholders, who elect a board of directors to direct the corporation and hire
                            its
                            managerial staff. A privately owned, for-profit corporation can be either privately held by
                            a small
                            group of individuals, or publicly held, with publicly traded shares listed on a stock
                            exchange.</p>

                        <p> Cooperative: Often referred to as a "co-op", a cooperative is a limited-liability business
                            that can
                            organize as for-profit or not-for-profit. A cooperative differs from a corporation in that
                            it has
                            members, not shareholders, and they share decision-making authority. Cooperatives are
                            typically
                            classified as either consumer cooperatives or worker cooperatives. Cooperatives are
                            fundamental to the
                            ideology of economic democracy. </p>
